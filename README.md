# Vim AKL

https://www.meetup.com/Vim-AKL/

This repo is where the Vim AKL meetup keeps its files and history. You can find the files we play with and the topics of discussion for each month in the corresponding folders. The README in each folder will also have a link to the video recorded during the meetup.

We're also maintaining [potential topics](potential-topics.md) for future meetups and the ones we've already covered.
